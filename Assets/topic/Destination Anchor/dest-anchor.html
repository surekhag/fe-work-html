Q: Normally when I use an <a>
element the browser underlines the text,
but when I used the id attribute instead of
href, it doesn’t.
A: Right. When you use the id attribute
it has no effect on the look of the text the
<a> element surrounds. Remember, the
point of the destination anchor is just to mark the location within
the page, not to create a link, so there isn’t
any need to display it visually.

    Q: Why is it called an anchor?
    What’s anchor-like about it?
    A: On this one we’re just going to say
    it like it is: ”anchor” was a bad choice of
    names and has confused tens of thousands
    before you, if not millions. We’re not even
    going to try to give you a cute metaphor
    to understand how it could possibly be an
    anchor. Basically we’re all stuck with the
    name, but now you do know what it does,
    and before long you won’t even give the
    name a second thought.<br></p>
    <p>
    Q: Well even with the bad name,
    why use the same element to do such
    different things? Why not have separate
    linking and destination elements?
    A: Think of it this way: you have to
    link from something to something else. The
    a element with an href provides a way
    to describe the from something. And the
    to something has always been just the top
    of the other Web page – in other words,
    you got the to something for free. With the
    destination anchor you can also define the
    to something yourself. So, while confusing,
    there is some sanity to the naming.<br></p>
    <p>
    Q: I noticed in the anchor id names,
    you used “chai” with all lowercase letters
    and Caffeine Buzz used “Coffee” with a
    upper case “C”. Does it matter?
    A: You can use any combination
    of upper- and lowercase characters in
    your id attributes. Just make sure you
    are consistent and always use the same
    upper- and lowercase letters in your hrefs
    and destination anchor id (which is why
    it is often easier to make these names
    entirely lowercase every time). If you aren’t
    consistent, don’t expect your links to work
    correctly on every browser.<br></p>
    <p>
    Q: Can I put a link to a destination
    anchor from within the same document?
    A: Sure. In fact, it is common to
    define a destination anchor “top” at the top
    of a page and have a link at the bottom
    of the page saying “Back to top”. It is also
    common in long documents to have a
    table of contents for the entire page. For
    instance, to link to the “top” destination
    anchor in the same page, you would write
    </p>

Q: If a Web page doesn’t provide a
destination anchor and I still need to link
to a specific part of the page, how can I?
A: You can’t. If there is no destination
anchor then you can’t direct the browser to
go to a specific location in a Web page. You
might try to contact the page author and
ask them to add one (even better, tell them
how!).
Q: Can I have a destination anchor id
like “Jedi Mindtrick” or does an id have
to be only one word?
A: To work consistently with the most
browsers, always start your id with a letter
(A-Z or a-z) and follow it with any letter,
digit, hyphen, underscore, colon, or period.
So, since you can’t use a space, you can’t
have a name like “Jedi Mindtrick”; but that
isn’t much of a restriction because you
can always have “Jedi-Mindtrick”, “Jedi_
Mindtrick”, “JediMindtrick”, and so on.
Q: How can I tell others what
destination anchors they can link to?
A: There is no established way of doing
this, and in fact, “View Source” remains the
oldest and best technique for discovering the
destination anchors you can link to.
