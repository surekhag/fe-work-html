<h1> The way Div works </h1>

    sometimes hard.</p>

    If you’ve already had some programming experience, then you know what we’re talking
    about. If you’re coming straight from Head First HTML and CSS, then you’re going to find
    writing code is a little, well, different. Programming requires a different way of thinking.
    Programming is logical, at times very abstract, and requires you to think in an algorithmic
    way. But no worries; we’re going to do all that in a brain-friendly way. Just take it a bit
    at a time, make sure you’re well nourished and get plenty of sleep. That way, these new
    programming concepts will really sink in.

<div id="div-cls-id">
<p id ="head">The activities are NOT optional.</p>
<h2> TEST Descendent Style</h2>
<p id = "desc">The exercises and activities in this book are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of
    the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some
    will help you apply what you’ve learned. Don’t skip the exercises. The crossword puzzles
    are the only things you don’t have to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to
    think about the words in a different context.
    The redundancy is intentional and important.<br/>
    One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to really get it. And we
    want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t
    have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about learning, so you’ll see some of the
    same concepts come up more than once.</p>

    <div class="div-cls1">
    <p id ="head">The examples are as lean as possible.</p>
    <p id = "desc">Our readers tell us that it’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of an example looking for
    the two lines they need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the
    smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. Don’t
    expect all of the examples to be robust, or even complete—they are written specifically for
    learning, and aren’t always fully-functional.
    We’ve placed all the example files on the Web so you can download them. You’ll find them
    at http://wickedlysmart.com/hfjs.</p></div>
